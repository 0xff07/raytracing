# About the Branch Name

It's call "superfast" not because it runs super fast. It's becaust that I expect it would run without cored dump or other faults, but it exits successfully and it generate a more or less decent result after compiled and run. Anyway, my code works, but I don't know why.

If you want to see original readme, check out the one on master branch.
